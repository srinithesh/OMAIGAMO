# Veridian Fleet - Backend Server (DEPRECATED)

**This directory is no longer in use.**

The application has been updated to use a more reliable in-browser analysis engine (Web Worker). You do **not** need to install any packages or run any server commands from this directory.

The application will work immediately without any backend setup.
